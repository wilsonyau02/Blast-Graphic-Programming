# ü§ñ Robot Prototype - Blast ü§ñ
> 202205 BACS2173 Graphics Programming

## Introduction

Our group, comprising of **Lee Chun Kai**, **Wilson Yau Kai Chun**, and **Eugene Law Kai Le**, have been chosen as the application designers for this project. Our task is to design a new robot prototype for the sequel ‚ÄúPacific Rim Uprising‚Äù. Being avid fans of the Pok√©mon franchise since childhood, we were inspired by one of its most iconic characters - Blastoise. Given that Blastoise is a water-themed Pok√©mon, and considering that most monsters or ‚ÄòKaiju‚Äô in the movie emerge from the water, we found it fitting to use it as our prototype. Thus, we named our model "Blast".

## Technologies Used
- C++ (Microsoft Visual Studio 2019)
- OpenGL
